# Machine learning Projects

This folder contains classification models where the goal is to predict a discrete label (e.g., churn vs no churn, conversion vs no conversion, readmitted vs not readmitted).

**Techniques used:**
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, LightGBM
- Handling class imbalance (SMOTE, class weights)
- Feature selection (VIF, SFS, feature importance)
- Evaluation: accuracy, precision, recall, F1, ROC-AUC
